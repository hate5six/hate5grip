# hate5grip

The hate5grip is a DIY wireless camera angle switcher using a Raspberry Pi Zero that sends HTTP POST requests to a Flask server running adjacent to OBS, which simulates the pressing of keys to initiate an angle switch. The grip can be used more generally as just a wireless macro keypad as needed. Code and .stl files for 3D printing to come. For a full breakdown, step by step guide and Q+A check out the livestream tutorial I'll be hosting about this build over at patreon.com/hate5six.
